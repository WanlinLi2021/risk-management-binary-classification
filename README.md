# risk-management-binary-classification

## Objective: 
Create a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup (a fictitious venture capital firm).

## Data:
A CSV file containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

This file contains various types of information about the organisations, including whether they ultimately became successful. 

## Strategy:
Create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

1. Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model

2. Compile and Evaluate a Binary Classification Model by Using a Neural Network

3. Optimize the Neural Network Model
